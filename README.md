My Dotfiles
===========

**Stratus3D**

Everything I need to get setup on a new machine.

This repository contains my Vim, tmux, Zsh, Bash, and asdf config files, a script to symlink all the config files and directories in place, and a set of setup scripts that install all the tools I need on Ubuntu or OSX.

## Features

* Vim, tmux, Zsh, Bash, asdf, and Git configurations
* Setup script that symlinks dotfiles and installs all the software I use
* A collection of Bash scripts I rely on for Erlang development
* List of commands I often forget

## Installation

#### Prerequisites

* `curl` - For the command below

#### Installation Steps
1. Run the `setup.sh`. This will install all the necessary software, setup commonly used directories, and install dotfiles. Since the setup script is idempotent it can be run on machines that have already been setup without causing issues.

        curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stratus3D/dotfiles/master/scripts/setup.sh | bash 2>&1 | tee ~/setup.log

    On Debian this is all you need to do. Everything should be installed and configured correctly. On OSX there are two remaining steps.


2. (OSX only) Configure iTerm2 to use the custom profile stored in the dotfiles directory. In the iTerm2 preferences window click the "browse" button and navigate to `~/dotfiles/iterm2_profile/` and select the plist file.

## Software

This is software that I need for my day-to-day programming work. I try to keep this list updated with the latest software I am using. This allows me to quickly setup new development machines. I am developing a script named checkenv.sh that will verify everything is setup properly.
